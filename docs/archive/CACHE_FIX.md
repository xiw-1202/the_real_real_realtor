# üö® NPM Cache Permission Fix

## The Problem / ÈóÆÈ¢ò
Your npm cache has root-owned files causing permission errors. This is a common issue.

## üöÄ Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Fix NPM Cache Ownership (Recommended)
```bash
# Fix the ownership of npm cache
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm

# Then clear cache
npm cache clean --force

# Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Solution 2: Use Alternative Cache Location
```bash
cd frontend

# Set npm to use a different cache location
npm config set cache ~/.npm-cache-alt

# Clear the new cache
npm cache clean --force

# Start the frontend
npm start
```

### Solution 3: Skip Cache Entirely
```bash
cd frontend

# Install without using cache
npm install --no-cache

# Start without cache verification
npm start --no-cache
```

### Solution 4: Use Yarn Instead of NPM
```bash
# Install yarn globally
npm install -g yarn

cd frontend

# Use yarn which has different cache management
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Solution 5: Reset Everything (Nuclear Option)
```bash
cd frontend

# Remove everything
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Fix npm permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm

# Fresh install
npm install

# Start
npm start
```

## üéØ Quick Fix Command Sequence

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm

# Go to frontend directory  
cd frontend

# Start the application
npm start
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view nyc-rental-assistant-frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.x.x:3000
```

## üîç If You're Still Getting Module Resolution Errors

After fixing the cache issue, if you still see "Can't resolve './App'", run:

```bash
cd frontend

# Check if App.tsx exists
ls -la src/App.tsx

# If it exists, restart with clean state
rm -rf .cache build
npm start
```

## üìù Notes

- The deprecation warnings are normal and don't affect functionality
- The vulnerability warnings can be ignored for development
- Focus on getting "Compiled successfully!" message

Try **Solution 1** first - it's the most direct fix for your specific issue!
